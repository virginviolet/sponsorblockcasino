class Log:
    """
    Provides functionality for logging events with timestamps to a file.
    For timestamps, the local time zone is used by default, but a different
    time zone can be specified.

    The log cannot be verified or generated from the blockchain.
    Use a validated transactions file for verification (see
    Blockchain.validate_transactions_file()).
    The log is meant to be a local record of interesting events on the server.

    Attributes:
        file_name: The name of the file where transactions are logged.
        time_zone: The time zone to be used for logging. If None, the
                    local time zone is used.
    Methods:
        __init__(file_name = "data/transactions.log", time_zone) -> None:
            Initializes the log file with the specified file name and time zone.
        create(): Creates the necessary directories and an empty log file.
        log(line, timestamp): Logs a line of text with a timestamp to the file.

            file_name: The name of the file where transactions are logged.
                        Defaults to "data/transactions.log".
            time_zone: The time zone to be used for logging. If None, the
                        local time zone is used. Defaults to None.

        Creates the necessary directories and an empty log file.
        This method performs the following steps:

        3. Checks if each directory exists, and if not, creates it.
        4. Creates an empty log file at the specified file name.
