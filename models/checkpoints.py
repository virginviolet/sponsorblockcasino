class ChannelCheckpoints:
    """
    ChannelCheckpoints is a class that manages checkpoints for a specific
    channel in a guild. It allows for saving, loading, and managing
    message IDs as checkpoints.

    Methods:
        __init__(self,
            guild_name,
            guild_id,
            channel_name,
            channel_id,
            max_checkpoints):
            Initializes checkpoints for a channel in a guild.
        count_lines(self):
        create(self):
            Creates a checkpoint file for the channel, including necessary
            directories and metadata files.
        save(self, message_id):
            Saves the given message ID as a checkpoint in the file.
            If the number of checkpoints exceeds the maximum allowed, the
            oldest checkpoint is removed.
        remove_first_line(self):
        load(self):
            Loads the checkpoints from the file specified by self.file_name.
